# NumPy Tutorial for Beginners

This repository contains a beginner-friendly tutorial on **NumPy**, one of the most powerful libraries for numerical and scientific computing in Python. The tutorial covers core concepts, array operations, memory behavior, and essential numerical techniques used in data science and machine learning.

## 🚀 What You Will Learn

### 1. Introduction to NumPy
- Why NumPy is essential for scientific computing.
- How NumPy uses **contiguous memory blocks** for improved speed and reduced storage.
- Comparison between Python lists and NumPy arrays in terms of **performance and memory efficiency**.

### 2. Understanding NumPy Arrays
- Vector dimensions (1D, 2D, and multi-dimensional arrays).
- How memory is allocated to NumPy arrays.
- Accessing and modifying elements in:
  - 1D arrays
  - 2D arrays (matrix indexing)

### 3. Array Indexing and Slicing
- Basic slicing operations.
- Reassigning array elements.
- Boolean indexing and masking.
- Advanced indexing using lists of indices.

### 4. Creating and Working with Random Arrays
- Using the `numpy.random` module.
- Generating random numbers, vectors, and matrices.
- Applications in simulations and testing.

### 5. Copying and Manipulating Arrays
- Difference between:
  - `arr = other` (reference)
  - `arr.copy()` (independent copy)
- Performing **element-wise operations** and broadcasting.

### 6. Matrix and Linear Algebra Operations
- Matrix multiplication using `np.dot()` and `@`.
- Determinant and eigenvalues using `numpy.linalg`.
- Practical use in machine learning and data transformations.

### 7. Stacking and Combining Arrays
- Horizontal stacking (`np.hstack()`)
- Vertical stacking (`np.vstack()`)

### 8. Loading External Data
- Importing data from text files into NumPy arrays **without using pandas**.
